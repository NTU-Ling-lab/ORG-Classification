%   This script provides an example for classifying ORG signals acquired in 
%   5 s recordings at a sampling rate of 200 B-scans per second using a
%   pretrained SVM model.
%
%   The script consists of three functions,
%   1) extract_ORG_signal: extracts phase-based ORG signals from registered
%   complex-valued OCT signals.
%
%   2) preprocessing: uses bandstop filters and a low-pass filter to remove
%   unwanted frequencies from raw phase traces.
%
%   3) SVM_classification: extracts Type-I and Type-II signals using a
%   pre-trained support vector machine (SVM) model.
