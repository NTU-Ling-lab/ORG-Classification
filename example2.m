%   This script provides an example for classifying ORG signals acquired in
%   prolonged recordings at a sampling rate of 25 B-scans per second using
%   a pretrained SVM model.
%
%   The script consists of two functions,
%   1) extract_ORG_signal: extracts phase-based ORG signals from registered
%   complex-valued OCT signals.
%
%   2) classification_prolonged_recording: extract Type-I and Type-II
%   signals using a pre-trained support vector machine (SVM) model and
%   further extract multilayerd ORG signals.
